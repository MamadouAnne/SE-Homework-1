	I'm thinking about this after having done this project, and watching a classmate using javascript externally.
	Creating javascript that is independent of the html seems to be really important. A method described to me 
	was via an array of the information needed from the html being available to the JS, so that neither is 
	dependent on what is contained within the other. Interesting stuff. I've thought of a couple of ways to do
	this. The first:

	<script>
		var arrInfo = (...args) => {
			args.forEach(value => arrInfo.push(value));
		}
	</script>
		^^This just creates one array of whatever arguments you're looking for. Potentially not great if you 
		need different sets of arguments for different functions in your javascript. But, this is useful as
		it's probably lightweight on the machine.

	The second:

	<script>
		function createArrWithSpecificArgs(...args){
			let arr = [];
			args.forEach(value => arr.push(value))
			return arr;
		}
	</script>
		^^This just takes in args, and outputs an array. I'm suspicious of this, as what you could do instead is,
		when your .js functions are used, is skip this whole thing and just do:
			<button onclick ="myFunction(arg1,arg2,...argN)"></button>
		The above does essentially the same as the second example.
